Visualizing 3D data
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h2></center>
The DV was offers some facilities to visualize 3D data sets. Specifically,
the <i>3D slicer</i> window allows one to choose a particular coordinate
slice of a register to display when the <b>Send to local view</b> is used.
As an example, there is a function, <b>inspiral</b>, in DV that produces
a 3D register containing an x-y-t slice of a black hole merger (calculated
using Newtonian gravity plus the quadrupole formula, and the output is
the Newtonian potential). After selecting <b>inspiral</b> from the function
window, enter the following arguments (1,10,1,120,100), and press <b>Go!</b>&nbsp;
(<b>NOTE</b>: <i>if you have a slower machine, it is advised that you reduce
the resolution by changing the arguments to something like (1,10,3,120,32)</i>
):

<p>Two registers, <b>inspiral_2D</b> and <b>inspiral_3D</b> should be produced.
Now click on <b>3D Slicer</b> in the main window, select the <b>inspiral_3D</b>
register, and click on <b>Send to local view</b>. In the 3D slicer window,
a point-map of the 3D data set is drawn, and various widgets allow one
to select different slices of this data. Changing a slice option causes
the corresponding 2D slice to be drawn in the 2D local view window. For
example, after some manipulation of the view (and changing some of the
<a href="sec_48.html">send options</a>), the 3D slicer window will look
something like this:
<p><img SRC="3d_1.jpg" height=496 width=538>
<p>and the corresponding z=62 slice (in this case) will look like this
in the 2D window:
<p><img SRC="local_view_3.jpg" height=706 width=718>
