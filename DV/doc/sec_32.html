Visualizing 2D registers
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h2></center>
DV provides a rendering tool to visualize 2D data as a surface plot. To
use it, <i>select</i> an individual grid, a set of grids, levels or times,
or even entire registers, and then click the <b>Send to local view </b>button
on the main window. Items on the main window can be selected or deselected
by clicking on them with the <i>left mouse button</i>. Selected items are
highlighted in yellow. For example, if you click on time level 5 of <b>2d_phi_0</b>
with the left mouse button, and then click on the <b>Send to local view
</b>button,
a window should pop-up that looks something like this:
<p><img SRC="local_view_1.jpg" height=706 width=718>
<p>If multiple objects are selected and sent, all corresponding grids will
be displayed sequentially in time; i.e., this is how you <i>animate</i>
a sequence of grids. An animation can be halted by pressing the <b>escape</b>
key. You can also single-step through the grids in a register by first
selecting one time (or level or grid), then, while the DV main window is
still the active one, press the <b>cursor</b> keys or clickon the
<b>up/down
arrow </b>buttons just below the <b>Send to local view </b>button.
<p>A short-cut for sending a single time, level or grid within a register
is to single click on the corresponding item with the <i>right mouse button</i>.
<p>The default annotation and color coding is as follows. The time of the
grid(s) is shown in the upper left corner of the view; directly below this
are the minimum and maximum function bounds in parenthesis. Grid functions
are converted to a surface plot where both the color and height of the
surface denote the magnitude of the grid function. The current function-value
to color conversion scale is given by the color bar on the lower right
portion of the view. The actual coordinate height of the surface is the
magnitude of the function multiplied by some constant scale ("zscale"),
the current value of which is displayed in the upper right corner. Below
the zscale label is the array size of the grid, and below this the coordinate
bounding box of the grid. NOTE: if multiple grids are rendered simultaneously,
only the array size and coordinate domain of the <i>last</i> grid that
is drawn is shown here.
<h3>
Changing the view</h3>
The image can be manipulated via the following click-and-drag operations,
which control a virtual track-ball:
<p><u><i>rotate</i>:</u>&nbsp; <b>left mouse button</b>&nbsp; or&nbsp;
<b>right mouse button</b>
<p><i><u>translate</u><b>:</b></i> <b>middle mouse button&nbsp;</b> or&nbsp;

<b>left mouse button &amp; Ctrl key</b>
<p><i><u>zoom</u></i>: <b>left mouse button &amp; middle mouse button</b>&nbsp;
or&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>middle mouse button &amp; Ctrl key</b>&nbsp; or&nbsp;
<b>left mouse button &amp; Shift key</b>
<p>The view can be reset to a user-definable default by clicking on the
<b>Home</b>
button. The default is specified via a spherical polar viewing angle <b>theta</b>
and <b>phi</b>, and a <b>zoom</b> factor.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>Parameters controlling how the surface plot is generated can be specified
via the <b>options</b> button on the main window, and are briefly explained
<a href="sec_48.html">here</a>.
<p>Rendering, annotation and screen capture parameters are set by using
the
<b>Options</b> menu on the local view window, and are explained <i>here
(under construction)</i>.
