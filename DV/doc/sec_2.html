Sending data using "sdftodv"
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h2></center>
Once DV is running, the easiest way to load data is by using the <b>sdftodv</b>
command, which sends data files that are in the <b>SDF</b> file format
to the DV server. Prior to using sdftodv from a remote location, one needs
to specify the internet address of the machine on which DV is running,
for example:
<p><tt>> setenv DVHOST bh8.physics.ubc.ca</tt>
<p>Also, if the DV was started with a port number other than the default
of 5005, one must set the DVPORT environment variable as was done when
<a href="sec_1.html">starting
the DV.</a>
<p>The simplest usage for sdftodv is
<p><tt>> sdftodv [-i 'ivec'] &lt;sdf_file_name> ...</tt>
<p>The 'ivec' is an optional index vector, that can be used to control
which data sets within the sdf files are to be sent.&nbsp; For example
<p><tt>> sdftodv ./DV/data/2d_example.sdf</tt>
<p>will send the entire file '2d_example.sdf' (which is located in the
'data' subdirectory of the standard DV distribution). To send the first
3 data sets, followed by the remaining even numbered ones from 6 onwards,
enter
<p><tt>> sdftodv&nbsp; -i '1-3,4-*/2' ./DV/data/2d_example.sdf</tt>
<p>Note that the entire index vector must be placed in quotes to prevent
the shell from interpreting any special characters.
