<p><b>Local view&nbsp;|&nbsp;HSV</b>:&nbsp;the widget at the top of the
screen is used to specify which GL&nbsp;canvas, i.e. the 2D local view
or the 3D slicer ("HSV"), to which the entered options will be applied.
<p><b>scale</b>:&nbsp;the scale factor by which to multiply grid function
values to determine the height of the 2D surface plot. A <i>relative</i>
scale can be specified using the notation <b>R#</b>,&nbsp; where <b># </b>is
the desired value. A relative scale adjusts the height of the surface to
be the specified fraction of the maximum width (coordinate domain) of the
data. For example, setting scale to <b>R.1 </b>will cause the height of
surface to be 0.1 times (10%) the width of the surface.
<p><b>z-clip min/max</b>: function values above the specified minimum and
maximum are clipped
<p><b>colormap min/max</b>:&nbsp;the minimum/maximum function values that
will be mapped to the minimum/maximum color indices in the surface-height
colormap. If left blank, then the global minimum/maximum function values
at the given time are used.
<p><b>3D clip</b>: if selected, then points that fall outside of the colormap
range are not drawn in the 3D slicer window.
<p><b>Linear | Log +- | Log + | Log-</b>: the type of function to use when
mapping function values to the colormap.
<p><b>Standard | B&amp;W | W&amp;B</b>: the color scheme to use (will be
expanded or made customizable in the future).
<p><b>mask</b>:&nbsp;when selected, a register, specified via the text
widget to the right, should be used to mask out excised/undefined function
values (as specified by the <b>value</b> widget). Function values that
are masked out will not be drawn. Two special cases for the mask register
are allowed: 1. an asterisk (<b>*</b>)&nbsp;means that the current function
that is being visualized should act as its own mask (this is useful for
grid functions where excised regions are set to a specific numerical value);
2. A forward slash (<b>/</b>) means that the subsequent text is to be interpreted
as a <i>tag</i>, and a register should be searched for that matches the
name of the register that is being viewed, except that a portion of its
named should be replaced with the tag. For example, if the mask register
is <b>2d_chr</b>, then specifying a mask <b>/chr</b> will allow <b>2d_chr</b>
to be used as the mask for registers with names like <b>2d_phi</b>, <b>2d_pi</b>,
<b>2d_f</b>, etc. Note that the mask register and register(s)&nbsp;being
displayed must have identical grid structure.
<p><b>filter</b>:&nbsp;when selected, a filter, as explained for use with
<a href="sec_33.html#Other_functions">functions</a>, can be used to select
a subset of a register to view.
<p><b>coarsen</b>: applies uniform coarsening (by the specified amount)
to registers before visualization, to speed up the display of high-resolution
grid functions on slower machines.
<p><b>sync by time index | sync by time value</b> :&nbsp;when animating
multiple registers simultaneously, this option specifies whether to used
the integer time levels of the register (starting at 1), or the actual
real times of corresponding time levels to synchronize the display. This
option is only interpreted when <b>concat. same time</b> is selected.
<p><b>no concatenation&nbsp;|&nbsp;concat. same time |&nbsp;concatenate
all</b> :&nbsp;this option allows one to choose whether/how multiple grids
are displayed simultaneously (when <b>concat. same time</b> is selected,
the definition of "same time" is controlled by the <b>sync by ...</b> options
above).
<p><b>monotone shading</b>: this option disables the colormap, and draws
surfaces with a single color that can be specified by via the <b>color</b>
button to the right.
<p><b>level(dx) coloring</b>: this option causes the grid function resolution
(specifically the resolution in the first, or x dimension) to be used to
define the surface color.<b></b>
<p><b>AMR</b>:&nbsp;this option causes finer resolution (higher level)
grids to mask out coarser level grids of the same register, in the region
of overlap between the grids. This is useful for visualizing grid hierarchies,
like those produced using adaptive mesh refinement.
<p><b>ignore c.c</b>: this option forces the surface generation procedure
to ignore any curvilinear coordinate information that may be associated
with a grid, displaying the surface with a uniform grid whose bounding
box matches that of the curvilinear coordinate domain.
<p><b>3D b.b only</b>:&nbsp;if selected then only render bounding box information
in the 3D slicer window.
