Browsing the contents of registers
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h2></center>
Each register can consist of an arbitrary number of grids. A given grid
within a register is identified by its <b>time</b>, <b>resolution</b>,
and <b>coordinate domain</b> that it occupies. In the DV, the grids are
organized as follows: a register consists of a set of distinct time levels,
each time level consists of a set of distinct resolutions (or simply <i>levels</i>),
and each resolution consists of a list of grids occupying different coordinate
domains. On the main DV window, this register structure can be browsed
by double-clicking relevant items with the left mouse button. For example,
double-clicking on <b>2d_phi_0 </b>will reveal the following:
<p><img SRC="DV_main_2.jpg" height=496 width=638>
<p>In this case, <b>2d_phi_0</b> has 11 time levels. Double-clicking on
time level 5 will show that there are grids with a single resolution (labeled
by the mesh spacing of the first coordinate <b>dx</b>) at this time:
<p><img SRC="DV_main_3.jpg" height=496 width=638>
<p>Finally, double-clicking on <b>dx(1)=...</b> above will show the single
101x101 grid stored there:
<p><img SRC="DV_main_4.jpg" height=496 width=638>
<p>To hide a sub-list of information, simply double-click on the corresponding
item again.
<p>The numerical contents of an individual grid can be viewed using the
data browser (DB). First, click on the <b>Data Browser </b>button on the
main window to open the DB window. Then, single clicking on individual
grids with the <i>middle mouse button </i>will refresh the DB window with
the corresponding data.
<p>NOTE: currently, only 1D and 2D grid functions can be viewed with the
DB; furthermore, the DB ignores curvilinear coordinate information, hence
the coordinate labels for such grids may be incorrect.
