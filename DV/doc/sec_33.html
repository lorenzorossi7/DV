Manipulating the contents of registers
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h2></center>

<h2>
<a NAME="deleting_items"></a>Deleting items</h2>
To delete registers, or individual grids/levels/times, select the corresponding
items on the DV main window using the left mouse button, then click on
the <b>Delete</b> button. For example, in the following we wish to delete
register <b>2d_pi_0</b> and times 2-6 of register <b>lambda</b>:
<p><img SRC="DV_main_5.jpg" height=496 width=638>
<p>After clicking on <b>Delete</b>, the following sub-window should pop-up:
<p><img SRC="DV_main_5_inset.jpg" height=124 width=243>
<p>Clicking on <b>Selected and Open</b> or <b>Selected</b> will delete
the desired items. An "open" item is one that is visible on the DV main
window. For example,&nbsp; <b>lambda</b>'s list of times are open in the
above screen shot. Double clicking on lambda will "close" the list of times,
however, any selected times will remain selected; hence the distinction
between the first 2 delete statements. <b>Delete All</b> will delete <i>all</i>
registers, regardless of which are selected. <b>Delete Last Time-Step of
Selected Registers</b> will delete the last time step of any <i>registers</i>
that are selected (this function is useful because the last time step of
an sdf file that is being produced by a program that is still running may
be incomplete due to disk buffering, and hence the last time step may contain
garbled data).
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="merging_registers"></a>Merging Registers</h2>
The <b>Merge</b> button on the main window can be used to collate the contents
of different <i>registers</i>. This is useful for parallel applications
that save different portions of the same grid function to separate files
on local machines. Then, after all the pieces of a grid are sent to the
DV from the various remote locations, they can be merged into a single
register. <b>Merge</b> is used in a similar manner to
<b>Delete</b> described
above.
<p><b>WARNING</b>:&nbsp; DV requires that all grids within a given register
be <i>unique</i>. Here, unique means that at least one of the following
attributes must be different between any two grids within a register: time,
resolution(level) and the coordinate domain occupied by the grid. Therefore,
if you merge registers that contain identical grids (i.e. non unique as
just defined), DV will discard all but one of the identical grids.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="differentiation"></a>Differentiation</h2>
The DV can calculate certain numerical derivatives of uniform grid functions.
Clicking on Differentiate in the main window will bring up the following
window:
<p><img SRC="diff_1.jpg" height=326 width=568>
<p>All registers currently in the DV are shown in both the <b>Differentiate</b>
list on the left (where one selects the register to differentiate), and
the
<b>mask</b> list on the right (where an optional "mask" register can
be selected) . The <b>w.r.t</b> choice box is used to select which coordinate
to differentiate with respect to. The default coordinate names are <b>t
</b>for
time, and <b>x1</b>,<b>x2</b>,<b>x3</b> for the first three spatial coordinates.
The particular finite difference stencil to use for spatial differences
is specified via the spatial stencil choice box (currently only 2 second
order accurate operators are provided). The current temporal difference
stencil is leap-frog at interior times, and standard second order accurate
forward and backward stencils applied to the first and last time of a register
respectively.
<p>The optional mask register can be used to specify an <i>excised region</i>
where grid function values are to be interpreted as undefined. The mask
register must have an identical structure compared to the&nbsp; register
being differentiated, and the region of the computational domain that is
treated as undefined are all grid locations where the mask grid function
has a numerical value equal to <b>mask value</b>. Standard second order
accurate forward and backward difference stencils are applied adjacent
to excised regions, as required not to reference undefined function values.
<p>The optional filter argument allows one to select portions of a register
to operate on, and is explained in the <a href="#Other_functions">other
functions</a> section below.
<p>When <b>Go!</b> is clicked, a new register with name specified by <b>new
name</b> will be created containing the result of the differentiation.
If the <b>over-write existing registers?</b> button is <i>not</i> selected,
then a warning prompt will be issued if a register with the name <b>new
name</b> already exists.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Other_functions"></a>Other Functions</h2>
Various other functions supported by the DV, such as simple arithmetic
operations, renaming registers, etc. can be accessed from the function
window, activated by clicking on the <b>Functions</b> button on the main
window:
<p><img SRC="function_1.jpg" height=576 width=668>
<p>In the function window, the desired function can be selected by clicking
on the corresponding item in the <b>Function</b> list on the left. Most
supported functions are either unary or binary: unary functions operate
on register <b>A</b>, while binary functions operate on registers <b>A</b>
and <b>B</b>. Register <b>A</b>(<b>B</b>) can be set by either typing its
name into the corresponding text widget, or left(right)-clicking on it
in the <b>Register</b> list to the right of the <b>Function</b> list. An
optional mask register, as explained in <a href="#differentiation">differentiation</a>
above can also be given, and can be selected by clicking on the register
name with the right mouse button in the <b>Register</b> list.
<p>Certain functions take arguments. The arguments are described in the
information box on the lower right portion of the window after the function
is selected, and the desired arguments can be entered in the <b>Arguments</b>
widget.
<p>With most functions a <i>filter</i> can be applied to the source registers
<b>A</b> and <b>B,</b> that cause the function to only operate on a portion
of the registers. When the button to the left of <b>Filter</b> is selected,
the filter, entered in the text widget to the right, is applied. The format
for the filter is as follows:
<p><b><tt>t=&lt;ivec>; l=&lt;ivec>; [cb=x1,x2,y2,y2,... | ib=i1,i2,j1,j2,...]</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>&lt;ivec></tt></b> is an <i>index vector</i> (as used by <b>RNPL</b>
for output control), which is a convenient notation for specifying sequences
of integers. An example of an index vector is <b>1,3,5-10/2,15-*</b>. Single
numbers are interpreted verbatim, a term <b>n1-n1/s </b>denotes the sequence
<b>n1,n1+s,n1+2s,...,n2</b>,
and an asterisk denotes the last valid index of the relevant data structure.
The <b><tt>t=&lt;ivec> </tt></b>statement selects a sequence of times (1
to the number of times within a register, with 1 being the earliest time),
and the <b><tt>l=&lt;ivec> </tt></b>statement selects a sequence of levels
(1 to the number of resolution-levels within a register, 1 being the coarsest
level). The <b><tt>cb=x1,x2,y2,y2,...
</tt></b>term specifies a <i>coordinate
bounding box</i>, whereby all data outside of the rectangle <b>[x1..x2,y1..y2,...]</b>
will be clipped. Similarly
<b><tt>ib=i1,i2,j1,j2,... </tt></b>specifies
an <i>index bounding box</i>, whereby each grid is clipped relative to
its array shape <b>[1..Nx,1..Ny,...]</b>. Only one of the coordinate or
index bounding box statements may be specified within a filter argument;
any combination of a time index vector, a level index vector, and a bounding
box statement may be specified --- multiple selections are interpreted
with a logical <i>and</i>.
<p>When <b>Go!</b> is clicked, a new register with name specified by <b>New
name</b> will be created containing the result of the differentiation.
If the <b>over-write existing registers?</b> button is <i>not</i> selected,
then a warning prompt will be issued if a register with the name <b>New
name</b> already exists.
<p><b>history</b> lists are available for many text widgets in DV, and
store a short list of the most recent entries of the corresponding text
widget. Selecting an item within the history will copy the item to the
text widget.
