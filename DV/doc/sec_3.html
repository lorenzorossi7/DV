Registers
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h2></center>
The DV organizes data sets into <b>registers</b>, which are ordered lists
of grid functions. A single register contains <i>all</i> the grid functions
for a single variable, and is identified by a unique character string (up
to 256 characters in length). The DV main window displays a list of all
current registers within the DV. As described in the next section, the
register list can be 'expanded'&nbsp; or 'contracted' to show more or less
information about the contents of given registers. Most of the functions
of the DV operate on entire registers.
<p>The following snapshot shows a sample of what the DV main window might
look like after sending the sample data file as described on the <a href="sec_2.html">previous</a>
page. In this case there is a single register "2d_phi_0".
