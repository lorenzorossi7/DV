listed below have been fixed

===============================================================================

The following lists a few of the not-so-obvious features of the Data Vault (DV).
Sometime in the future more thorough documentation will be provided.

===============================================================================

Use the utility 'sdftodv' to send SDF files to the DV.

Main window
-----------

The "Data-Vault contents" browser presents a list of all registers
currently in the DV.

A register is a list of grids, sorted first via time, then level.
Double clicking on a register will "open" it, displaying a list of times.
Doubling clicking on a time will open a list of levels at that time.
Double clicking on a level will display the grids that exist at that level 
and time. Double clicking an open item will close it.

Single clicking with the left mouse button selects/deselects multiple
items in the browser list.
Single clicking with the middle mouse button single-selects the clicked
item. 
Single clicking with the right mouse button on a time/level/grid
will send the corresponding information to the local view 
(i.e. a short-cut for clicking with the middle button, then clicking on
the "Send to local view" button).

If the "Data Browser" is open, middle/right mouse clicks will update
its view with the selected grid. Note that opening the data browser
will NOT refresh it, i.e. a grid must be selected afterwards.

The "Send to" buttons send all selected items to the corresponding
visualization servers. Note that, as of this time, the send operations
cannot be aborted once started (will add an escape feature in the
near future).

If you hold down the shift key while selecting an item from the "Edit"
menu, then the operation will only apply to the set of selected objects
in the browser. 

When sending a large SDF, you can force the display to update and
show what part of it is currently in the DV by selecting the "Refresh Now"
option from the "View" menu. 

"Write SDF to file" in the File menu only writes one register, regardless
of how many you select.

known bugs ---- the main window is always beneath all other DV windows
           ---- sometimes when sending a grid to the local view with
                the right mouse button, all grids below it in the browser
                list also get sent (I think this is an Xforms bug).

Differentiate window
--------------------

known bug --- The first time this window is opened, always select a register
              to differentiate first before selecting "with respect to"

Function window
---------------

"Filter" is an optional string used to select a subset of the source registers
to be operated upon. The format is 

"t=ivec;l=ivec;cb=coordinate bbox;ib=index bbox"

Each piece is optional, and the ordering is arbitrary (although only
1 of cb or ib will be interpreted). "t" selects a set of time indecies,
for example "t=1-10/2,15,20-*/5"; "l" selects a set of level indecies;
"cb" specifies a coordinate bounding box via
"x1_min,x1_max,x2_min,x2_max,x3_min,x3_max", for example (2D) "cb=0,1,-1,2.3";
and "ib" specifies an array-index bounding box, via
"imin,imax,jmin,jmax,kmin,kmax".
The parser for the filter string isn't very smart at this time ---
it doesn't give format error messages, but simply ignores parts of the string
it doesn't understand. So an internal trace statement has been
left on that echo's what has is recognized.

The Mask register is an optional argument recognized by some grid functions,
and can be used to restrict the operation to a subset of the grid.
Whenever Mask==Mask value, the operation is *NOT* applied (or the corresponding
point in the new grid is set to zero)

known bugs ---- the filter function that clips grids sometimes seems to shift
                the new grids a tiny bit in coordinate space (as if there was
                some round-off error, but with double precision the round-off
                shouldn't be noticable?)
           ---- the power function (and perhaps some of the others) doesn't handle 
                divide by zero situations properly yet (e.g. x^(-1), when x=0.
           ---- the 2Dcluster function operates 'illegally' --- it adds new grids
                to a "clusters" register regardless of the "New name" field,
                and doesn't clear any existing grids in "clusters". 

Send to local view and the DV local view window
-----------------------------------------------

The local view shows 3D surface plots of 2D uniform grids. The "options"
button on the main window opens a dialog box with several options controlling
how these surfaces are built. The "options" menu  on the "DV local view" window
controls how surfaces are drawn, *after* they have been built and sent. 
In other words, if send-options are changed, the grids need to be re-sent for
the options to take effect, however options-menu selections take effect immediately.

send options:
-------------

   scale --- changes height of the surface
             use 'R#' to specify a height relative to the largest horizontal
             dimension of the data. For example 'R0.5' chooses a scale factor
             so that the maximum vertical dimension of the surface is 1/2 that
             of the maximum horizontal dimension. 

   z-clip min/max --- adds clipping planes at the specified locations, i.e.
             nothing below zmin or above zmax will be displayed.

   colormap range --- the smaller/larger value of the grid function that gets
             mapped to the corresponding minimum/maximum value in the colormap
             range. If a field is left empty, then the corresponding
             minimum/maximum value of the function is used.

   colormap type --- when a logarthmic map is chosen, then the range is
             interpreted as the smallest/largest absolute magnitude of the
             function. Use Log+ for positive functions, Log- for negative,
             and Log+- for indefinite functions (in this case the upper half of the
             colormap gets used for positive values, the lower half for
             negative).

   Mask and filter operate as described in the "Functions" dialog. 
             Grid points masked or filtered out do not get drawn. 
             If Mask="*", then the function masks itself. If the mask name is 
             preceded by a forward-slash (/), then the DV is searched for a 
             mask register with a similar name to the grid being sent, except 
             that the middle part of the name is replace by the rest of the mask. 
             For example, with Mask="/chr", the register "gr_phi_0" would get 
             masked by "gr_chr_0".

             NOTE: currently, a filter only works when either the "concat. same time"
                   or "concatenate all" option described below is selected.

   coarsen --- N:1 coarsening of the data, for quicker rendering.
   
   sync by time index/sync by time value --- when multiple registers are sent,
             this option controls the order in which grids are sent. 
             In the main browser list, times are shown as "t(10)=2.345", for 
             example. 10 is the time-index in this case, 2.345 the time-value.

   no concatenation/concat. same time/concatenate all
             no concatenation --- all grids sent are drawn 1 at a time
             concat. same time --- grids that share the same time index
             or value (as specified by the preceeding parameter) get drawn
             at the same time.
             concatenate all --- all grids sent are drawn on the same view.

   AMR --- When turned on, this button will mask out the shape of any child
           grids (i.e. higher level numbers/finer resolution) that might exist 
           for a given grid. Use this option when sending an AMR hierarchy if
           you only want to see the finest data available at any point.

   The "history" buttons at various locations record a brief history of the
   corresponding dialog enteries, for convenience (though when the buffer is 
   filled, the history is cleared, not 'shifted').

Local view operation and options:
---------------------------------  

The view is controlled via the mouse, with a track-ball emulation and controls
similar to that of explorer. For example, the left MB rotates, the middle MB
translates, and left+middle MB zooms.

The "Home" button resets the view with the specified zoom/theta/phi parameters.
The corresponding zoom/theta/phi buttons record a history of recent paramaters,
like the send option history buttons. 

Annotation --- see the defaults for examples on the format of on-screen text
               strings.

               Note : when text or the colormap is interactively placed on the GL 
                     canvas, the *entire* canvas is redrawn with each
                     repositioning, including any grids that are displayed. So 
                     for speed, alter the on screen annotation with a coarsened 
                     version of the data.

Screen Capture ---- this dialog can be used to save snapshots of the view
               to disk in jpeg format. Note that *every* redraw of the GL
               canvas will be saved after "Start Capture" is selected, so even
               though the canvas window doesn't have to be on top, if you
               move other windows over it, the canvas will get refresh messages and
               save multiple snapshots of the view.
           
               known bugs --- The screen capture "Browse" button doesn't work reliably yet,
                             and can crash the DV.

known bugs --- the surface-normal calculation isn't working properly at the 
               edges of grids, and so AMR data drawn with the "Smooth Solid"
               mode may show artificial seams between adjacent grids.
